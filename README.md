# Grade_Cafe

GradCafe is a platform where grad school applicants share admission status and communicate updates. One thing all applicants need is information - when to expect an interview, whether being put in a waiting list or receiving an email starting with Congratulations. The uncertainty that comes with these questions can be relieved to certain degree with information from other applicants.

For those freshly admitted grad students, they are curious about what they can know about application in Statistics over the last decade from GradCafe, where I have access to 10,000 application results from 2010 to 2020 with information on the program, year, applicant undergrad GPA, GRE result, admission status, etc.

I also incorporate two major university rankings in Statistics: U.S. News and QS World University Rankings as these rankings are reliable indicators of academic reputation of a particular university and program, which can affect decisions of both applicants and programs significantly. Besides, these two rankings are selected to represent the major domestic and international evaluation of universities.

With three datasets on admission result and ranking scraped, I am able to answer two major questions below.

1. What kind of programs are popular among the applicants in Statistics?
2. What kind of applicants are usually preferred by Statistics graduate programs?

Datasets:
1. gradcafe.csv
2. USnew_overall
3. USnew_stat_rank.csv
3. qs_rank.csv

Rest please see the analysis report.
